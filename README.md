FORKED FROM NRGJOBRO

the one purpose for this is to make a 1.19.51 version of horion source(but knowing how retarded i am, im gonna fail) but for the most part its for fun

I also have a second branch where ill try to do other things but at the same time push commits from the original 1.18.12 source from NRG and MarioCST's Source cause his source was the one that actually inspired me to do it
